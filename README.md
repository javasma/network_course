# Course in Network Science - online material

This repo contains jupyter notebooks, paper exercises and datasets to support 
the course 
### 'Introduction to complex network analysis' 
by Prof. Jörg Menche assisted by Dr. Felix Müller from the University of Vienna. 

Some tutorial parts are based on the online material from

## Howto run Jupyter Notebooks

Our coding tutorials can be run with Python 3.  


If you prefer not to rely on interactive Colab notebooks, you can run Python locally on your computer by installing Jupyter/IPython. We recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) Python distribution with Python 3. Required Python modules can be installed using pip or conda.

To get started, create a folder on your machine and clone this repository into it. Open your terminal and use the following command:

> git clone git@github.com:menchelab/network_course.git

(alternative option: > git clone https://github.com/menchelab/network_course.git)

and update on a weekly basis with

There will be changes in the main branch by us on a regular basis. Make sure that you have the latest version of the current notebooks by downloading them to your local machine:

> git pull origin main
  
Save your own modified notebooks as `Lastname_Matrikelnr_LectureNr.ipynb`.
